# Finding Probability of an Event using Stimlulation
In the notebook examples, i first calculated the desired probability and then ran stimulations to check whether its gibing the correct output or not. But this method would be better used when its very difficult to calculate the probability or calculating it takes a lot of computation or time. 

## Interprating the grpah
In the graph shown below we can see that as the number of iterations increases for a stimlulation, the probability gets more and more close to the required probability. In this case we know beforehand what probability we are expecting.
